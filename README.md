# WeatherApp
Side-project inteded to exercise my own Python skills as well as expose myself to different APIs. Also, this would be a useful tool to have as it is. 

# Intention
To design a script/application that will send an alert on the weather report for the day of interest. A simple yet useful application for someone like myself who may forget to check the weather for the day before heading out the door.

# Right Now
The script using Twilio as the SMS Gateway service (using a trial period). This is a temporary solution. I cannot afford to pay for an SMS gateway service, and with some other network setup, I can avoid the costs altogether while still achieving similar results. 

# Future
I intend to purchase a Raspberry Pi in order to set up a server location to schedule this script with Cron. This way I can ensure that the task will execute at the same time every day, and I can save the money by avoiding using an SMS Gateway service.
